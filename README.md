# my-first-website
This is the first website I ever created.  I used my daughters softball team as the subject.


For this studio assignment I chose to add the first website I ever created.  This was my final project for the Web Fundamentals class with Professor Mertz. I used Brackets as my code editor and referenced the following sites often.

www.w3.org

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ 

https://validator.w3.org/

https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

What I learned from building this site was that it is unrealistic to expect myself to memorize everything there is to know to be a web developer.  What was more important was to learn how to learn and know where to look and who to ask.  I also learned how to be comfortable making mistakes.  Alot of my learning came from trial and error.  Overall, I really enjoyed the process.
