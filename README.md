# my-first-website
This is the first website I ever created.  I used my daughters softball team as the subject.

You can add a project from either your CMST 103 or 135 course.  Part of this process will be to create a readme file that describes your project.  This description should describe the technologies that you used and links to references that you used when doing your project.  Reflect on what you learned doing the project.

This assignment you should:

Create and use a repository
Start and manage a new branch
Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
Open and merge a pull request


For this studio assignment I chose to add the first website I ever created.  This was my final project for the Web Fundamentals class with Professor Mertz. I used Brackets as my code editor and referenced the following sites often.

www.w3.org, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/, https://validator.w3.org/, https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

What I learned from building this site was that it is unrealistic to expect myself to memorize everything there is to know to be a web developer.  What was more important was to learn how to learn and know where to look and who to ask.  I also learned how to be comfortable making mistakes.  Alot of my learning came from trial and error.  Overall, I really enjoyed the process.
