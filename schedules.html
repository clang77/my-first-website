    <h2 id="content">Our Schedule</h2>
    <p>We practice and play softball year round!  Our season begins in the Spring and lasts all Summer long.  We even play into the Fall!  Tournaments are organized and usually played in the Kansas City area.  They begin on a Friday and end on Sunday.<br><br>Our favorite tournament to play in is the Colorado Sparkler! It is a week long tournament where we compete with other teams from all over the United States. It usually takes place in July and we also have time to explore the Colorado mountains and beautiful scenery.<br><br>When the season is over, we still get together to practice once every week, usually during the weekend.  If the weather is nice, we will be outside on a softball field.  When the weather is too wet or cold, we have an indoor facility we use to practice in.  We do all kinds of hitting and fielding drills to keep our skills sharp!  We have even participated in indoor softball tournaments during the winter months!  They are held at the indoor football practice field at Missouri Western University in Saint Joseph Missouri.<br><br></p>
